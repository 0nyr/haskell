-- All the paper proofs like:
--  + finding function most general type
--  + determining strictness of arguments
--  + proofs by inductions of properties of functions
--  + proof by contradiction that a function is not an homomorphism
-- are in the paper exam.

-- Calculator is not needed for the exam.

-- In first exercices, you need to evaluate by hand some expressions 
-- 1)
computeSillyList = [a + b | a <- [3..5], odd a, b <- [a..7]]

-- 2)
computeSillyFoldl = foldl (-) 4 [4,5,6]

computeSillyFoldr = foldr (-) 4 [4,5,6]

-- 3)
computeSillyMap :: [(Integer, Maybe Integer)]
computeSillyMap = map g [1..5]
    where
        g x = (x*x + 1, Just x)

-- The following exercices are to find some expression in order 
-- to rewrite some functions in terms of other functions.
-- 4)
function4 :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> [b]
function4 f z xs = scanl f z xs

function4' :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> [b]
function4' f z xs = map delta (inits xs) 
    where
        delta ys = foldl f z ys

-- Following questions are about writing functions
-- 5)

-- checkIsOrdered (x:y:xs) = (x <= y) && checkIsOrdered (y:xs)
checkIsOrdered (x:y:xs) = if x <= y then checkIsOrdered (y:xs) else False

-- 6) Insert at position
insertAt :: Int -> a -> [a] -> [a]
insertAt 0 x xs = x:xs
insertAt n x (y:ys) = y : insertAt (n-1) x ys

-- 7) Write a function that return the list of permutations of a list
-- example: myPermutations [1,2] = [[1,2],[2,1]]
-- example: myPermutations [1,2,3] = [[1,2,3],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[1,3,2],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]
