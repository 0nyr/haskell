-- 1. p::(a->Bool) answers whether the problem can be solved directly.
-- 2. b::(a->b) solves the problem directly.
-- 3. d::(a->[a]) divides the problem into a list of subproblems.
-- 4. c::(a->[b]->b) combines the solutions of the subproblems.

-- the smallest unit (1 element), then compare each element with the 
-- adjacent list to sort and merge the two adjacent lists. 
-- Finally, all the elements are sorted and merged.
