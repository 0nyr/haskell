-- # So, what is a homomorphism?
-- A homomorphism is a structure-preserving map 
-- between two algebraic structures of the same type.
-- It is a map between 2 monoids.
-- A monoid is a set with a binary operation 
-- and an identity element.

-- # example 1:
-- 2 + 3 = 5
-- e^2 * e^3 = e^(2+3) = e^5
-- here, the product to the sum relationship 
-- on exponents is a homomorphism

-- # example 2:
-- length :: [a] -> Int
-- length :: ([a], ++, 0) -> (Int, +, 0)
-- length is a list homomorphism
-- ([a], ++, 0), and (Int, +, 0) are monoids
-- length [] = 0
-- length (xs ++ ys) = length xs + length ys

-- # example 3:
-- h : [a] -> S
-- h : ([a], ++, []) -> (S, *, e)
-- h is a list homomorphism
-- ([a], ++, []) and (S, *, e) are monoids
-- h [] = e
-- h (xs ++ ys) = h xs * h ys

-- # example 4:
-- product :: Num a => [a] -> a
-- product :: ([a], *, 1) -> (a, *, 1)
-- product is a list homomorphism
-- ([a], *, 1) and (a, *, 1) are monoids
-- product [] = 1
-- product (xs ++ ys) = product xs * product ys

-- # example 5:
-- reverse :: [a] -> [a]
-- reverse :: ([a], ++, []) -> ([a], ++, [])
-- reverse is a list homomorphism
-- ([a], ++, []) and ([a], ++, []) are monoids
-- reverse [] = []
-- reverse (xs ++ ys) = reverse ys ++ reverse xs

-- # example 6: merge sort
-- sort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
-- sort :: ([a], ++, []) -> ([a], merge, [])
-- sort is a list homomorphism
-- ([a], ++, []) and ([a], merge, []) are monoids
-- sort [] = []
-- sort (xs ++ ys) = merge (sort xs) (sort ys)

-- # example 7: NOT a homomorphism
-- average :: [Int] -> Int
-- avegage (xs ++ ys) = average xs ? average ys
-- average [] = undefined !!!
-- average has no neutral element, 
--      hence it is not a homomorphism

-- let's prove that average is not a homomorphism
-- Assume that average is a homomorphism, i.e.
-- there exists an operator # such that:
-- average (xs ++ ys) = average xs # average ys
-- then:
--    average [1,1,2] = average([1,1] ++ average [2]) 
--    average [1,1,2] = average [1,1] # average [2]
--    average [1,1,2] = 1 # 2
--    average [1,1,2] = average [1] # average [2]
--    average [1,1,2] = average ([1] ++ [2])
--    average [1,1,2] = average [1,2]
-- the upper is false, avg(1,1,2) != avg(1,2) 
-- hence average is not a homomorphism

-- we define the following h function:
hom :: (a->b) -> (b->b->b) -> b -> [a] -> b
hom f op e = foldr op e . map f
-- h is a list hommorphism
